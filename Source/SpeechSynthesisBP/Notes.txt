TODO: Use Unreal Engine's reflection system to build the voice signal's fundamental- and formant-frequencies.
TODO: Provide the library sine wave generator with a 10s decay envelope to simulate (human) lung capacity.
TODO: Use a breath blueprint which can be used after 5s of speech to simulate a window for the speaker to take a breath.

Notes

Manually adding blueprint macros toa project seems to break subsequent builds or else are ignored by the UE INI pkg compiler.
Adding custom blueprints as C++ compenents in the UE event graph seems to work fine. Each blueprint class is then compiled as a separate implementation file.
