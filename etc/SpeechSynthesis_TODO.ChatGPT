Your approach to extract frequency components from output values to regenerate sound using sinusoidals is an interesting and sophisticated method, often employed in signal processing, 
especially in speech synthesis and analysis. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you in your research and implementation:

### 1. **Sound Analysis and Frequency Extraction**:
   - **Fourier Transform**: Use the Fourier Transform, specifically the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), to convert time-domain signals into the frequency domain. 
   This step decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies.
   - **Spectral Analysis**: Analyze the spectral content to identify dominant frequencies, harmonics, and other characteristics. Tools like spectrograms can be visually informative.

### 2. **Frequency Component Isolation**:
   - **Filtering**: Apply filters (band-pass, low-pass, or high-pass) to isolate specific frequency components.
   - **Windowing**: Use windowing techniques in time-domain analysis to manage signal discontinuities at the beginning and end of each frame.

### 3. **Sinusoidal Modeling**:
   - **Modeling Frequencies**: Model each isolated frequency component as a sinusoidal wave. This involves determining amplitude, phase, and frequency for each component.
   - **Parameter Estimation**: Estimate these parameters for each sinusoidal component. Techniques like peak picking in the frequency spectrum can be useful.

### 4. **Sound Reconstruction**:
   - **Synthesis**: Combine the sinusoidal components to reconstruct the sound. This process involves summing up all the sinusoidal waves with their respective amplitude, frequency, and phase.
   - **Overlap-add Method**: In the case of frame-based processing, use the overlap-add method to reconstruct the time-domain signal from overlapped, windowed frames.

### 5. **Application to Other 'Phones'**:
   - Once you have the sinusoidal model, you can apply it to synthesize speech sounds (phones) in different contexts.
   - **Formant Analysis**: For speech, understanding formants (resonant frequencies of the vocal tract) is crucial, as they are key to differentiating phonemes.

### 6. **Considerations for Speech Synthesis**:
   - **Coarticulation**: Be aware of coarticulation effects in speech where the articulation of a sound is influenced by preceding and following sounds.
   - **Prosody**: Incorporate prosodic elements such as intonation, stress, and rhythm for natural-sounding speech synthesis.

### 7. **Software and Tools**:
   - Utilize signal processing libraries in Python (like NumPy, SciPy) or MATLAB for analysis and synthesis.
   - Tools like Praat can be valuable for speech signal analysis.

### 8. **Machine Learning Approaches**:
   - Consider using machine learning, especially neural networks, for more advanced modeling and synthesis. Techniques like Deep Learning can capture complex patterns in speech.

### 9. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Rigorously test the synthesized sounds to ensure they match the intended output, especially when applied to different languages or dialects.
   - User studies or perceptual tests can be helpful in assessing the quality of synthesized speech.

### Conclusion:
Your research into using sinusoidals to regenerate sound from frequency components is a complex task that intersects with many aspects of signal processing and speech synthesis. 
It requires careful consideration of both the mathematical models and the perceptual aspects of sound and speech. With the right approach and tools, 
this method can be highly effective for applications like text-to-speech systems, speech modification, and other audio processing tasks.
