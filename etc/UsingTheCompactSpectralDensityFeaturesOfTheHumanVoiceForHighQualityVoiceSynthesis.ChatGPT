Because the spectral density of the human voice is compact is it feasible to archive sinusoidal samples at all relevant frequency and amplitudes and then factor each audio frame for these values?

Your idea of archiving sinusoidal samples at various frequencies and amplitudes specifically tailored to the human voice, and then factoring each audio frame to match these values, is a fascinating approach. Let's break down this concept and assess its feasibility:
Understanding the Spectral Density of the Human Voice

    Compact Spectral Density: The human voice typically has a relatively compact and well-defined spectral range. Most of the energy is concentrated in specific frequency bands (formants), which are key in determining the characteristics of speech sounds.
    Harmonic Nature: Vocal sounds are often harmonic, meaning they consist of a fundamental frequency (the pitch) and its harmonics (integer multiples of the fundamental frequency).

Archiving Sinusoidal Samples

    Creating a Database: This would involve recording or generating sinusoidal samples that cover the typical range of frequencies and amplitudes found in human speech.
    Challenges:
        Variability in Voices: There is significant variability in human voices, including pitch range, timbre, and intensity. A comprehensive archive would need to account for this variability.
        Storage and Retrieval: The database could become quite large, and efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms would be necessary.

Factoring Audio Frames

    Analysis Method: Each audio frame of a voice recording would be analyzed to determine which combination of archived sinusoidal samples best represents it.
    Potential Techniques:
        Match Pursuit or Similar Algorithms: These algorithms could be used to iteratively approximate each audio frame by selecting the best matching sinusoids from the archive.
        Custom Algorithms: Developing a custom algorithm that factors in the unique properties of human speech might yield better results.

Feasibility and Considerations

    Computational Complexity: This approach may be computationally intensive, especially for real-time applications.
    Accuracy vs. Efficiency: Achieving a high level of accuracy in matching the voice signal might require a large number of sinusoidal samples, potentially leading to efficiency issues.
    Adaptability: The system would need to be adaptable to different speakers, accents, and speech patterns.
    Application Scope: This method might be particularly useful for high-quality voice synthesis or voice transformation applications where precision is more important than computational efficiency.

Conclusion

    Innovative Approach: This method presents an innovative approach to voice analysis and synthesis, potentially offering high-quality results.
    Research and Development: It would require significant research and development to address the challenges of variability in human voices, computational efficiency, and the practical implementation of the database and analysis algorithm.
    Potential Applications: If successfully developed, such a system could have applications in areas like high-fidelity voice synthesis, personalized voice assistants, and advanced speech processing.

In summary, while the concept is theoretically feasible and could offer a high-quality alternative to traditional methods, it presents substantial challenges in terms of implementation and practicality. This approach would be an interesting area for further research and development in the field of speech processing and synthesis.
