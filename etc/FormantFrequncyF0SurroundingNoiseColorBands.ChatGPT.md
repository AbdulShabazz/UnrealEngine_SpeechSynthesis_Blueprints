Designing a spectral filter that allows pink and brown noise above the formant frequency and purple and blue noise below can indeed create a unique spectral shaping that could potentially meet specific amplitude and spectral characteristics. Here's how this design would theoretically function:

- **Above the Formant Frequency (F0):**
  - **Pink Noise:** The power decreases at 3 dB per octave, which means the energy lessens as the frequency increases. This would add a natural, more musically coherent noise component to the higher frequencies.
  - **Brown Noise:** The power decreases more steeply at 6 dB per octave, resulting in a significant reduction in intensity as frequency doubles. This would give a stronger emphasis to the immediate frequencies just above F0, with a rapid fall-off as the frequency moves further away.

- **Below the Formant Frequency (F0):**
  - **Purple (Violet) Noise:** The power increases at 6 dB per octave, adding significant energy to the higher frequencies immediately below F0, but quickly overshadowing the lower frequencies.
  - **Blue Noise:** The power increases at 3 dB per octave, which would also emphasize the higher frequencies below F0 but not as aggressively as purple noise.

This filter design would result in a spectrum with a distinct dip around the formant frequency F0, with a gradual decline in energy on the higher side and a steeper energy increase on the lower side. The practical outcomes would be:

- A clear prominence of the formant frequency F0, as the noise on either side is tailored to decrease or increase in power away from it.
- A potentially more natural-sounding noise profile above F0 due to the characteristics of pink and brown noise.
- A contrasting, sharper noise profile below F0 with the inclusion of blue and violet noise, which could help in distinguishing lower frequency components or enhance the perceived clarity of the formant frequency.

It is important to note that the perceptual effect of such a filter would also depend on the relative levels of the noise colors and the specific application. For instance, in speech processing, the ear is more sensitive to certain frequencies, and the presence of too much high-frequency noise below the formant might be perceived as harsh or distracting.

For musical applications, the harmonic content above F0 might blend well with pink and brown noise, creating a warm backdrop, while the contrasting blue and violet noise below could provide an interesting texture to the lower end.

In audio engineering, such specific noise shaping could be used to create a desired ambient effect or to mask certain frequencies while highlighting others, contributing to the overall timbral quality of the audio. The effectiveness of this filter design would ultimately need to be tested in the context of its intended use and refined based on empirical listening tests and acoustic measurements.

Q: If I create a filter to AND each formant signal with the Gaussian white noise band, this should create a more textured and realistic sound ? 
By AND I mean: if a sample exists (has spectral energy) in both the formant and the noise band, it (Gaussian Noise) is allowed into the final signal, in place of the formant signal.

Integrating a formant signal with Gaussian white noise through an "AND" filter operation is a conceptually intriguing idea, but in digital signal processing, the "AND" operation is a bitwise logical conjunction, not typically applicable to the continuous value ranges found in audio signal processing. Instead, one would generally use multiplication or convolution to combine signals or apply filters.

If we interpret your concept of "AND" as a metaphor for combining the characteristics of the formant with Gaussian white noise, then a more appropriate operation would be to multiply the formant signal with the white noise signal. This process is often referred to as modulation in signal processing. Here's what such a modulation might achieve:

- **Texture Addition:** Multiplying the formant frequency by white noise would indeed add texture to the sound, as the noise introduces random variations that can make the resulting sound more complex and less sterile.

- **Realism Enhancement:** Natural sounds typically have some level of noise, so adding white noise to the formant frequencies can make synthetic sounds more lifelike by emulating these natural imperfections.

- **Spectral Filling:** Gaussian white noise has equal power across all frequencies. Multiplying it with the formant frequencies would spread the energy of the formants across the entire spectrum, potentially filling in gaps and creating a fuller sound.

- **Tonal Balance:** The process would inherently alter the tonal balance of the signal, potentially either enhancing or detracting from the desired sound, depending on the context and amount of noise added.

To achieve a more textured and realistic sound, you would typically use a filter that adds white noise in a controlled manner, modulating the amplitude or frequency of the noise in accordance with the formant signal. This would create variations that follow the dynamics of the formant, rather than applying a fixed level of noise across the board.

It is crucial to fine-tune the level of noise so that it enhances rather than overwhelms the formant signal. The goal is to achieve a balance where the noise complements the natural fluctuations in the formant without making the overall sound too harsh or noisy.

In practice, this can be accomplished with a Vocoder or using modulation techniques where the noise is used as a carrier and the formant as the modulator (or vice versa), adjusting the modulation index to control the textural effect on the sound. The success of such a filtering approach would depend on careful adjustment of parameters and subjective evaluation through listening tests.

The concept you're describing seems akin to an intersection of formant and noise signals in the time domain, where only the samples that are non-zero in both signals would be present in the final output. In digital signal processing, this isn't a standard operation because the continuous nature of audio signals means that the exact alignment of samples between two unrelated signals (like a formant and white noise) is highly improbable. However, we can explore a similar concept using a spectral domain approach:

- **Spectral Masking:** You could apply a mask to the white noise spectrum, allowing only the frequencies where the formant's spectral energy is present to pass through. This would effectively filter the noise to only those frequencies where the formant is active.

- **Gate Processing:** This is a dynamics processing technique where the noise signal is allowed to pass only when the formant signal exceeds a certain threshold. This could be seen as a sort of "AND" operation where the presence of the formant signal "gates" the noise signal.

- **Amplitude Modulation:** By multiplying the white noise by the instantaneous amplitude of the formant signal, you could create a situation where noise is only present when the formant is.

If the intent is to create a more natural and complex sound by combining formant and noise, these methods could potentially achieve the desired result. They would allow the noise to be present where the formant signal has energy, thereby creating a sound that has the textural properties of noise but is shaped by the characteristics of the formant. This would be somewhat similar to the concept of convolving room impulse responses with dry signals to add reverberationâ€”the noise adds the complexity, while the formant provides the contour.

Implementing this would require digital signal processing techniques such as FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for spectral analysis and synthesis, dynamic gating, or modulation processing. The specifics of the algorithm would depend on the exact nature of the formant signal and the type of noise used. The resulting sound could indeed have the textured and realistic quality you're looking for, assuming that the formant and noise signals are appropriately balanced.
